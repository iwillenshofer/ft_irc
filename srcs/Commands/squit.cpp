/*
** 4.1.7 Server quit message
** Command: SQUIT
** Parameters: <server> <comment>
** 
** The SQUIT message is needed to tell about quitting or dead servers.
** If a server wishes to break the connection to another server it must
** send a SQUIT message to the other server, using the the name of the
** other server as the server parameter, which then closes its
** connection to the quitting server.
** 
** This command is also available operators to help keep a network of
** IRC servers connected in an orderly fashion.  Operators may also
** issue an SQUIT message for a remote server connection.  In this case,
** the SQUIT must be parsed by each server inbetween the operator and
** the remote server, updating the view of the network held by each
** server as explained below.
** 
** The <comment> should be supplied by all operators who execute a SQUIT
** for a remote server (that is not connected to the server they are
** currently on) so that other operators are aware for the reason of
** this action.  The <comment> is also filled in by servers which may
** place an error or similar message here.
** 
** Both of the servers which are on either side of the connection being
** closed are required to to send out a SQUIT message (to all its other
** server connections) for all other servers which are considered to be
** behind that link.
** 
** Similarly, a QUIT message must be sent to the other connected servers
** rest of the network on behalf of all clients behind that link.  In
** addition to this, all channel members of a channel which lost a
** member due to the split must be sent a QUIT message.
** 
** If a server connection is terminated prematurely (e.g. the server  on
** the  other  end  of  the  link  died),  the  server  which  detects
** this disconnection is required to inform the rest of  the  network
** that  the connection  has  closed  and  fill  in  the comment field
** with something appropriate.
** 
** Numeric replies:
**         ERR_NOPRIVILEGES                ERR_NOSUCHSERVER
** 
** Example:
** SQUIT tolsun.oulu.fi :Bad Link ? ; the server link tolson.oulu.fi has
**                                 been terminated because of "Bad Link".
** :Trillian SQUIT cm22.eng.umd.edu :Server out of control
**                                     ; message from Trillian to disconnect
**                                    "cm22.eng.umd.edu" from the net
**                                     because "Server out of control".
**
** [IMPLEMENTATION NOTES]
** This command takes no actions, as server-server communication is not implemented.
