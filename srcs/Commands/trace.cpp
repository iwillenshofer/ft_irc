**	RFC 2812: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2812
**	3.4.8 Trace message
**	Command: TRACE
**	Parameters: [ <target> ]
**	
**	TRACE command is used to find the route to specific server and
**	information about its peers.  Each server that processes this command
**	MUST report to the sender about it.  The replies from pass-through
**	links form a chain, which shows route to destination.  After sending
**	this reply back, the query MUST be sent to the next server until
**	given <target> server is reached.
**	
**	TRACE command is used to find the route to specific server.  Each
**	server that processes this message MUST tell the sender about it by
**	sending a reply indicating it is a pass-through link, forming a chain
**	of replies.  After sending this reply back, it MUST then send the
**	TRACE message to the next server until given server is reached.  If
**	the <target> parameter is omitted, it is RECOMMENDED that TRACE
**	command sends a message to the sender telling which servers the local
**	server has direct connection to.
**	
**	If the destination given by <target> is an actual server, the
**	destination server is REQUIRED to report all servers, services and
**	operators which are connected to it; if the command was issued by an
**	operator, the server MAY also report all users which are connected to
**	it.  If the destination given by <target> is a nickname, then only a
**	reply for that nickname is given.  If the <target> parameter is
**	omitted, it is RECOMMENDED that the TRACE command is parsed as
**	targeted to the processing server.
**	
**	Wildcards are allowed in the <target> parameter.
**	
**	Numeric Replies:
**			ERR_NOSUCHSERVER
**	
**		If the TRACE message is destined for another server, all
**		intermediate servers must return a RPL_TRACELINK reply to indicate
**		that the TRACE passed through it and where it is going next.
**	
**			RPL_TRACELINK
**	
**		A TRACE reply may be composed of any number of the following
**		numeric replies.
**	
**			RPL_TRACECONNECTING           RPL_TRACEHANDSHAKE
**			RPL_TRACEUNKNOWN              RPL_TRACEOPERATOR
**			RPL_TRACEUSER                 RPL_TRACESERVER
**			RPL_TRACESERVICE              RPL_TRACENEWTYPE
**			RPL_TRACECLASS                RPL_TRACELOG
**			RPL_TRACEEND
**	
**	Examples:
**	TRACE *.oulu.fi                 ; TRACE to a server matching
**									*.oulu.fi
