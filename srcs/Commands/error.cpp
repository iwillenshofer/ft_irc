**	RFC 2812: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2812
**	3.7.4 Error
**	Command: ERROR
**	Parameters: <error message>
**	
**	The ERROR command is for use by servers when reporting a serious or
**	fatal error to its peers.  It may also be sent from one server to
**	another but MUST NOT be accepted from any normal unknown clients.
**	
**	Only an ERROR message SHOULD be used for reporting errors which occur
**	with a server-to-server link.  An ERROR message is sent to the server
**	at the other end (which reports it to appropriate local users and
**	logs) and to appropriate local users and logs.  It is not to be
**	passed onto any other servers by a server if it is received from a
**	server.
**	
**	The ERROR message is also used before terminating a client
**	connection.
**	
**	When a server sends a received ERROR message to its operators, the
**	message SHOULD be encapsulated inside a NOTICE message, indicating
**	that the client was not responsible for the error.
**	
**	Numerics:
**			None.
**	
**	Examples:
**	ERROR :Server *.fi already exists ; ERROR message to the other server
**									which caused this error.
**	
**	NOTICE WiZ :ERROR from csd.bu.edu -- Server *.fi already exists
**									; Same ERROR message as above but
**									sent to user WiZ on the other server.
