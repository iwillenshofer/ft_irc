**	RFC 2812: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2812
**	3.6.3 Whowas
**	Command: WHOWAS
**	Parameters: <nickname> *( "," <nickname> ) [ <count> [ <target> ] ]
**	
**	Whowas asks for information about a nickname which no longer exists.
**	This may either be due to a nickname change or the user leaving IRC.
**	In response to this query, the server searches through its nickname
**	history, looking for any nicks which are lexically the same (no wild
**	card matching here).  The history is searched backward, returning the
**	most recent entry first.  If there are multiple entries, up to
**	<count> replies will be returned (or all of them if no <count>
**	parameter is given).  If a non-positive number is passed as being
**	<count>, then a full search is done.
**	
**	Wildcards are allowed in the <target> parameter.
**	
**	Numeric Replies:
**			ERR_NONICKNAMEGIVEN           ERR_WASNOSUCHNICK
**			RPL_WHOWASUSER                RPL_WHOISSERVER
**			RPL_ENDOFWHOWAS
**	
**	Examples:
**	WHOWAS Wiz                      ; return all information in the nick
**									history about nick "WiZ";
**	
**	WHOWAS Mermaid 9                ; return at most, the 9 most recent
**									entries in the nick history for
**									"Mermaid";
**	
**	WHOWAS Trillian 1 *.edu         ; return the most recent history for
**									"Trillian" from the first server
**									found to match "*.edu".
