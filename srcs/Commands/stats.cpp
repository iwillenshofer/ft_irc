**	RFC 2812: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2812
**	3.4.4 Stats message
**	Command: STATS
**	Parameters: [ <query> [ <target> ] ]
**	
**	The stats command is used to query statistics of certain server.  If
**	<query> parameter is omitted, only the end of stats reply is sent
**	back.
**	
**	A query may be given for any single letter which is only checked by
**	the destination server and is otherwise passed on by intermediate
**	servers, ignored and unaltered.
**	
**	Wildcards are allowed in the <target> parameter.
**	
**	Except for the ones below, the list of valid queries is
**	implementation dependent.  The standard queries below SHOULD be
**	supported by the server:
**	
**			l - returns a list of the server's connections, showing how
**				long each connection has been established and the
**				traffic over that connection in Kbytes and messages for
**				each direction;
**			m - returns the usage count for each of commands supported
**				by the server; commands for which the usage count is
**				zero MAY be omitted;
**			o - returns a list of configured privileged users,
**				operators;
**			u - returns a string showing how long the server has been
**				up.
**	
**	It is also RECOMMENDED that client and server access configuration be
**	published this way.
**	
**	Numeric Replies:
**			ERR_NOSUCHSERVER
**			RPL_STATSLINKINFO                RPL_STATSUPTIME
**			RPL_STATSCOMMANDS                RPL_STATSOLINE
**			RPL_ENDOFSTATS
**	
**	Examples:
**	STATS m                         ; Command to check the command usage
**									for the server you are connected to
